How this works:
I am using a Raspberry Pi 3B (that one with WiFi) and that 7 inch Touchscreen from Raspberry.
On that Pi i am running an JavaFX application (i only can programm java - i'm sorry) to send UDP Packets to the selected IP-address.
This is how you install JavaFX for Raspbian: https://wimdeblauwe.wordpress.com/2017/08/26/using-javafx-on-raspberry-pi-3-with-gluon/

In theory, you could control your lamp from everywhere in the world if you port forward the port from the sketch (4210) to your ESP and it should work.
It controls Color (RGB, Rainbow, Fade and Sparkling), Brightness, Distance between the colors in that Rainbow mode and fading speed.
In my JavaFX Controller are two time that controlling part, as you can controll two devices at the same time, as i do, because i have another LED Strip under my bed.
